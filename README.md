# Lagrange-Squares

In this personal project I seek to find an efficient algorithm that retrieves the 4 squares that add up to a number according to Lagrange's theorem. I also am including a file with the tests that i've used in order to determine what is the optimal method.

Most of the algorithms were not designed by me but are an adaptation to those proposed in the 2018 paper "FINDING THE FOUR SQUARES IN LAGRANGE’S THEOREM"
